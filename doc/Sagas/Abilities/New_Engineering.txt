# Sagas new Engineering Documentation
Engineering should be about the combination of multiple parts into one larger part. For this reason each make skill has been reduced to base components. All this components receive a corresponding make skill somewhere before the skills that need them. You can still buy these made items, but they are meant to be cheaper if made by hand through gathered materials.

# Engineering Layout
Engineering is a bit more complicated than other classes. I can't simply lay it out and put the skills in order. Based on what I want to do with engineering and hopefully with other classes, I need to take this step by step.

# 1) Review of base components per skill
Makecontainer - Fabric
Makecomlink - Battery, Circuit
Makeflashlight - Battery, Circuit, Lens
makeblade - Durasteel, Battery, Circuit
makebinders - duraplast/durasteel
makegrenade - drink container, battery, circuit, chemicals or damage type component
	grenade effects: Probably have multiple effects. Inciendiary, Explosive, Stun, Sleep, Poison
	Chems:	Combustible Chemicals(inciendiary), Durasteel(explosive), Superconductor (stun), Sedatives (sleep), Poison (poison grenade)
makecanteen - Not in, necessary. Really want to find a better use for this than just makegrenade without introducing thirst. I'm thinking energy drinks to increase skill learning for a bit
makejewelry - rare metal
makemissile - 
makegoggles - lens, battery, circuit, duraplast
makelandmine - drink container, battery, circuit, chems/damage type component (see grenade)
makepike - durasteel, battery, circuit
makeshield - crystal, battery, circuit, durasteel
makebug - duraplast, circuit, battery
makeblaster - Durasteel, Circuit, Superconductor, Battery, Ammo. (represents simple blaster pistol)[add below for different models]
	Rifle - Scope
	Repeater - Cooling unit
	Heavy Pistol - Energy Focuser
makearmor - Fabric/Duraplast/Durasteel
makepowerarmor - Durasteel/Duraplast, Circuit, Superconductor, Battery
makeshipbomb - this is most likely getting removed.
