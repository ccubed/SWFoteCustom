SWFoteCustom FEATURELOG

This log covers what the long term goals are I'm shooting for. It does not cover changes made to reach those goals. For those see the Changelog. As features are made, they are removed from this list and added to the CUSTOMLOG which logs all changes I have made that separate this from stock FOTE.

1. Finish Ability Levels 2.0

2. Espionage Ability
	Goal Statement: Make a class for espionage pursuits such as monitoring people with cameras and bugs.
	Individual Tasks:
		A) Planning
			Status: Haven't Started
			
3. Merge Engineering and Technician
	Goal Statement: These two classes being separate doesn't make a whole lot of sense. The goal is to merge them later on.
	Individual Tasks:
		A) Planning
			Status: Haven't Started
			
4. Rework Slicer
	Goal Statement: This comes after Espionage because some Slicer skills may be better as Espionage skills. Additionally, some slicer skills are traditionally overpowered in a play environment as they have no counter and some just don't make sense. The idea is to look at existing slicer skills, decide if they should be changed, moved or removed and then add new skills to further beef up the slicer class.
	Individual Tasks:
		A) Planning
			Status: Haven't Started
			
5. Individual Humanoid Races
	Goal Statement: Individualize each humanoid race. Echani, Hapan, Mandalorian, etc.
